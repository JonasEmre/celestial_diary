# Celestial Diary
Celestial Diary is a web application developed using Python and the Flask web framework. The purpose of the application is to provide users with a platform to write about their daily experiences and record their feelings and emotions.
Additionally, the application utilizes astrology to record the moon and other planetary positions on the day the user writes their diary entry.

The application provides a modern and intuitive interface for users to write their entries, and allows them to customize the date and time of their entry. Users can also track their moods and feelings over time and see how they correlate with the positions of the planets.

In addition to the diary functionality, Celestial Diary also features a section for news and articles about planet positions and their meanings, as well as a section for hermetic philosophy.

Overall, Celestial Diary is a unique and powerful tool for users to reflect on their daily experiences and gain insights into the connections between their emotions and the movements of the planets.
